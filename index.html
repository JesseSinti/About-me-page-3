<h1 id="About_Me_Page">About Me!</h1>
<p class="lines">My name is Jesse Sintikakis, im 18 and a student at basecamp.
I came to basecamp in order to become a software developer because they make a lot of money. 
I wanted a career that makes a lot quick and also has many growth oppurtunities.
Im looking to invest into realestate and start building passive income so later on I wil have a lot of money.</p>

<h1 class="heading">Jesse's Dream Vehicles</h1>
<p class="lines">I've always like mustangs, I seen them on tv all the time while watching movies, even out in public. I thought they were awesome and I would love to have one.
I don't just want a generic one, i'd like one that is a shelby gt 500 and I wanna mod it out. 
I also would like to have a GMC Sierra 2500HD blacked out for my truck in the future.

<h1 class="heading">Jesse's Pets</h1>
<p class="lines">I have had all kinds of pets growing up as a kid. 
When I was younger I ended up getting a english bulldog name Deuce.
I also got a pacman frog while we were on vacation in Florida.
When I was around 14 I had gotten a blue tongue skink name Hobbs.
As of now I have a french bulldog name Bogie.
